Here Are Some Options"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>With the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/tile-flooring\/\">floor tile installation services<\/a>, drywall technicians, and painters, you can change the look of your living room, up to a point. However, you may not know what to do about your outdated fireplace. You don&#8217;t like the look of it, but tearing it out would be expensive and make a terrible mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you have a third option: You can have the fireplace refaced to change its look into one that you love and that fits the overall character of the room better. Refacing only affects the surface of the fireplace to alter the appearance, leaving its inner workings untouched. There are a number of materials available for refacing, and in many cases, the new veneers can be installed right over the old ones. Here are some options to consider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tile<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to end up with a more traditional-looking fireplace, tile is the quintessential choice. However, tile is a versatile material that also offers plenty of contemporary colours and styles. Generally speaking, tile is one of the more affordable options, but it depends on the type and brand that you choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Concrete<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you are looking for a more modern or contemporary look, concrete may be your best option. Depending on what the existing surface is made of, it can be applied by hand and either textured or made smooth. If concrete is a little too cold or impersonal for you, stucco is a great alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Masonry<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Masonry refers to brick, a classic fireplace material. However, masonry veneers are usually used for refacing a fireplace rather than full-sized bricks. Masonry veneers look almost identical to the real thing, so much so that they are sometimes referred to as &#8220;thin bricks.&#8221; You can apply masonry veneers to existing bricks or any other material the surface is currently made out of. There is a wide range of patterns and colours available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stone<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Types of natural stone used for fireplace refacing include granite, soapstone, quartz, or slate. If these sound like the same materials used for countertops and kitchen backsplashes, it&#8217;s because they are. Using the same type of stone for fireplace refacing that you use in the kitchen could be a way of creating a cohesive design scheme throughout the entire house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natural stone fireplace facings are elegant and timeless, but they do not come cheap. As with masonry, there are veneers that mimic the appearance of natural stone at a much more affordable price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wood<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Refacing the fireplace with wood gives you a lot of different options. You can give it a crisp, clean, traditional look by painting or staining it, or you can create more of a rustic feeling by leaving it unfinished. When refacing a working fireplace with wood, you do have to take some precautions. Wood is a flammable material that could ignite. Fire codes place limitations on wood fireplaces in the interest of safety, and you have to make sure that the installation is compliant. If you can reface the fireplace with wood, you have lots of options to choose from, some of which are very affordable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the International Building Code, you must have six inches between the sides of your working fireplace and any combustible material. Any applicable local codes with a stricter requirement supersede this. Therefore, you may need to choose another, non-flammable refacing material in addition to wood to get the look you want from your fireplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Floor Tile Installation Services Can Help With Fireplace Refacing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may not see the connection initially, but if flooring services in Vaughan can lay new tile on your floor, they can install it around your fireplace as well.

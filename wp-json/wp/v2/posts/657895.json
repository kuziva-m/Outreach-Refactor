The best way to avoid common summer plumbing problems is to work with <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/plumbing\/\">plumbing installation services Vaughan<\/a>. Professionals are better suited to making repairs and upgrades to existing systems than well-intentioned homeowners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many homeowners are eager to test their DIY skills, most plumbing repairs are unsuitable for amateur DIYers. Too much can go wrong when working on existing systems, resulting in more significant expense, despite the DIY draw being fewer costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, it is often best to avoid expenses altogether. If you take care of your plumbing system, especially when problems are minor, you can keep repairs to a minimum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3 Common and Avoidable Plumbing Problems<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People tend to think that winter is the worst time of the year for plumbing. While Canadian winters are harsh and frozen pipes are a significant concern, the summer months can be equally threatening to your plumbing system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, summer plumbing problems stem from additional wear and tear on the system. In the summer, people, including the kiddos, tend to spend more time at home. When you spend more time at home, you tend to use the plumbing more than during other times of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a homeowner, it pays to acknowledge the most common plumbing problems in the summer months. Knowing the issues can help you avoid them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Slow-Clearing Shower Drain<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A slow-clearing shower drain typically occurs because of a blockage or clog. In the summertime, there are many potential culprits to the clogged drain. First, you tend to bring more dirt and debris into the shower because you spend more time outdoors in warmer weather. Also, excess hair can contribute to the slowing of a drain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can avoid some of these issues by using drain traps or covers. Some covers slip right over the existing drain in the shower, allowing water to pass through but stopping hair and other debris.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your drain does slow up, you should contact a licensed plumber immediately. Plumbing services typically offer drain cleaning, which is often necessary if your drain slows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Clogged Toilet or Shower Drain<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A clogged toilet or shower drain differs slightly from a minor shower blockage. Legitimate clogs do not permit water or waste to pass through the line. The more you flush or rinse down the drain, the more backed up the line becomes, and the harder it is to clear it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you experience a toilet backing up or a tub that won&#8217;t drain, contact a plumbing service right away. Leaving clogs to clear on their own does not usually end well; you may just find a sewage-filled bathroom someday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Clogged Sewer Lines<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a clogged toilet may not end with a waste-filled basement, a clogged sewer line just might. Blocked sewer lines can occur for a number of reasons, including flushing things you shouldn&#8217;t or tree roots in the pipes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring a plumbing service for annual cleaning can help avoid these unfortunate events. Especially with the busy summer season coming, it is best to hire a service earlier in the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plumbing and Water Leak Repair Services in Vaughan<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you believe your plumbing system is in tip-top shape, you should have annual inspections. Plumbing is one of those essential systems with no easy way to assess it. If it has been a while since your last system inspection, contact <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/\">Handyman Connection<\/a> and schedule an inspection with a licensed and experienced residential plumber. They will come out and assess your system and make any suggestions about plumbing repairs or upgrades.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Plumbing systems require regular maintenance, but even then, things can go wrong.

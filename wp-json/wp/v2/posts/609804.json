You need light switches positioned where you can easily turn them on before you enter a dark room. They also need to comply with building codes in your local area. Work with an <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/electrical\/\">electrician in Vaughan<\/a> to find the proper placement and safe installation of light switches for your home and around your property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Safe Switch Locations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most building codes require light switches to be placed at every door entering the room. You don\u2019t want to walk across your bedroom or living room in the dark before you turn the lights on. This can be dangerous, particularly if there is a stairway in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Standard Installation Heights<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check with a contractor who knows your local building code to find out the required height or range of heights for light switches in your home. In the past, the standard height for light switches in Canada was 48 inches from the floor. Most modern homes have switch boxes that are centered at 42 inches from the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This height is comfortable and safe for most people. There are a few situations where you may wish to reduce the height for a more comfortable switch position, so consider the following situations as you look for the best height for your light switches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Kitchen Light Switches<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchens and bathrooms require special light switch considerations due to countertops and cabinets. Depending on your design, you may not have available wall space around 42 or 48 inches. If this is the case, then you\u2019ll need to adjust your positioning to place a switch as close to the standard positioning as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most homes, switches are placed 4 inches above the countertops. Since most countertops are about 36 inches high, this puts the switches at a slightly lower height of 40 inches. An important reason for this additional space is to make room for the countertop backsplash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Best Height for Accessible Homes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone in your household uses a wheelchair, then 42 inches may be uncomfortably high for a light switch. Work with a local electrician to discuss your options for compliant, comfortable switch positioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, you can install switches at a slightly lower level. Discuss the most convenient height for you and your household to find a solution that balances standard requirements with your personal preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another accessibility concern is the style of switch. If you or someone in your household has arthritis, standard switches may be uncomfortable to turn on and off. Ask a local electrician about switch options that are more comfortable for your household and guests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child-Safe Switch Installation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some switches are best placed high enough to keep away from children. Here are some common switches that you may wish to move as you schedule electrical repair services in your home:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Hot tub timer<\/li><li>Garbage disposal<\/li><li>Whirlpool tub jets<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These items aren\u2019t safe for children to turn on or off. For the safety of your household, consider placing these switches slightly higher to keep away from small children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whirlpool and hot tub switches also need to be at least 5 feet away from the tub. This reduces the risk of electric shock for two reasons. First, it makes it impossible to stand in the water while operating the switch. Second, it reduces the risk of water splashing and hitting the switch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Schedule an Installation Service With an Electrician in Vaughan<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t attempt to move or install switches without the help of a locally licensed electrician. <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/free-estimate\/\">Request an estimate<\/a> for electrical installation or repair services in Vaughan to see how Handyman Connection can keep your home safe and comfortable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*All electrical work is subcontracted to <a href=\"https:\/\/esasafe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ECRA\/ESA<\/a> Licensed Electrical Contractors<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Proper light switch locations keep your home safe, convenient and compliant.

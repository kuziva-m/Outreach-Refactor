However, if you don&#8217;t have much experience, you may make mistakes without realizing it. In contrast, hiring professional <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/painting\/\">painting services in Vaughan<\/a> ensures you never have to deal with the following errors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Using the Wrong Brushes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you visit the hardware store, you&#8217;ll find dozens of paintbrushes and rollers. Each has a particular use, and without background knowledge, you may pick up the wrong one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, contractors understand the intricacies of their tools. For example, they know you should only use a paintbrush for small spaces. Trying to paint an entire wall with a brush is time-consuming and unnecessary, but a thin edge is great for trim work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For large areas, they stick to a roller. These tools can cover walls and ceilings quickly with minimal reloading. A long handle gives them the furthest reach, ensuring they don&#8217;t need a ladder to reach the highest points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also understand the difference between natural and synthetic options; paintbrushes and rollers come in both kinds. Polyester brushes and nylon rollers are best for latex paint, while bristle brushes and wool rollers are best for oil-based paint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Getting the Wrong Kind of Paint<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of paint you need depends on the material you&#8217;re covering and whether it&#8217;s interior or exterior. If you&#8217;re painting the exterior of your house or furniture for the backyard, contractors recommend paint specifically formulated for outside exposure. Ultraviolet radiation breaks down the chemical bonds in paint, making it fade and peel faster. Exterior formulas are UV-resistant, allowing them to protect the material beneath from the elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interior walls don&#8217;t need the same protection, though a professional may use moisture-resistant paint if the area has high humidity. Bathrooms are a good example, as they&#8217;re routinely exposed to steam. Excess moisture can cause peeling, mould and other issues; water-resistant formulas last longer and can even protect your walls from humidity damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Running Out of Paint<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having to pick up more paint in the middle of a project can be irritating, especially if you&#8217;re short on time. The best way to prevent running out of paint is to correctly calculate how much you need beforehand. To do so, contractors measure the surface&#8217;s square footage, then determine how many cans of paint they need. Paint cans come in five-, one- and half-gallons, and they can cover 350 to 400 square feet with one gallon of paint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, most paint jobs require more than one coat. Typically, professionals use a primer to ensure they only need two or three coats for an even, opaque finish. Primer also offers several other benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Conceals stains<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Improves paint adhesion<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Seals underlying surface<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, correctly storing paint can keep it effective for longer. For example, cans stored in a cool place away from sunlight keep their consistency for up to five years. Extreme heat or cold can ruin the formula, leading to peeling or bubbling when applied. Contractors also extend the life of their paint by replacing the lid when the can isn&#8217;t in use. Doing so prevents the paint from drying out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Picking the Wrong Colour<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Colour is more than a visual descriptor \u2014 it can actually affect your psychological state. As a result, choosing the wrong paint colour can impact your mood or even your ability to sleep. Professionals understand this and can advise you on the best hues for a particular space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you need your home painted, it&#8217;s time to find a handyman in Vaughan.

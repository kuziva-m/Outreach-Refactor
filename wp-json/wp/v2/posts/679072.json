The disposal can clog or malfunction if overused, leading to costly <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/plumbing\/\">plumbing repair<\/a> bills. But how can you tell if you need plumbing repair? Common signs include slow draining or water backup, foul odours, or strange noises coming from your pipes. Some issues can be fixed with simple DIY solutions, while others require the expertise of a professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/home-installation-north-york-on\/\">Handyman Connection Vaughan<\/a>, we offer local handyman services and can help you diagnose and repair any plumbing issues you may have. In this blog article, we&#8217;ll go over the common items that shouldn&#8217;t go in garbage disposal to avoid any costly plumbing repair bills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Items That Could Spell Disaster for Your Garbage Disposal<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The efficient functioning of your garbage disposal relies heavily on what you put, or perhaps more importantly, what you don&#8217;t put inside. Several common kitchen waste items can inadvertently damage your disposal unit, leading to costly repairs or replacements. Understanding what doesn&#8217;t belong in a&nbsp;disposal can prolong the useful life of your unit and prevent avoidable plumbing issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Non-Biodegradable Materials:<\/strong> First and foremost, remember that your garbage disposal isn\u2019t a&nbsp;trash bin. Refrain from disposing of non-biodegradable materials such as plastic wrappers, glass, metal, or paper. These items can dull or jam the blades of the disposal, and even cause motor burnout. They will also accumulate over time, leading to clogs in your plumbing system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fibrous or Stringy Foods:<\/strong> Celery, corn husks, onion skins, and even banana peels are all examples of fibrous or stringy foods that your garbage disposal will struggle with. They can wrap themselves around the disposal blades, ultimately resulting in a&nbsp;tangled mess that reduces the efficiency of the device.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grease and Fats:<\/strong> Pouring grease, fats, or oils down your garbage disposal might seem harmless at first. However, over time, these substances can solidify and cause serious blockages in your plumbing. Even if they\u2019re in a liquid state while pouring, they can turn solid in the pipes, creating stubborn clogs that impede the wastewater flow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Large Bones and Shells:<\/strong> Despite their power, garbage disposals are not equipped to handle large bones and shells. The hardness of these items can damage the blades or overload the motor, leading to a&nbsp;potential breakdown of the unit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coffee Grounds:<\/strong> A&nbsp;little-known fact is that coffee grounds can create issues for your garbage disposal. They can accumulate in drains and pipes, eventually forming a&nbsp;sludgy substance that blocks the lines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding and being proactive about what you put down at your disposal, you can keep your unit running optimally for years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Consequences of Negligent Disposal Practices<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial to understand the ramifications of disposing of inappropriate items in your garbage disposal. A&nbsp;seemingly minor slip-up can cause significant issues that are both time-consuming and costly to fix. To help you avoid these problems, we at Handyman Connection would like to provide some insights into the consequences of unchecked disposal habits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of these consequences includes damaging your garbage disposal unit. Sharp or hard objects, for example, can blunt the disposal&#8217;s blades. It&#8217;s essential to remember that these appliances are not designed to handle anything more solid than food waste. So, even something as seemingly harmless as small bones or fruit pits can lead to costly blade repairs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dumping fibrous or starchy items into your disposal can lead to a&nbsp;different type of damage. These materials can form stubborn clogs, hindering the unit&#8217;s functionality and necessitating professional plumbing intervention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the direct harm to the garbage disposal unit, improper waste disposal can also cause extensive plumbing issues. For instance, oil and grease can accumulate in the pipes, leading to severe blockages. This issue not only interrupts the normal waste flow but could also result in pipe damage, which often entails a&nbsp;more expensive repair process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, improper waste disposal can negatively impact the environment. For instance, dumping chemical waste down your disposal could eventually seep into the soil and water supply, causing harm to wildlife and potentially tainting our watershed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring responsible disposal habits is not just about maintaining a functional garbage disposal unit. It&#8217;s also about taking a proactive stand to safeguard our plumbing systems and, by extension, the environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2024\/03\/Garbage-Disposal-content-image.jpg\" alt=\"Garbage Disposal Units\" class=\"wp-image-679074\" srcset=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2024\/03\/Garbage-Disposal-content-image.jpg 750w, https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2024\/03\/Garbage-Disposal-content-image-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Best Practices for Long-Lasting Garbage Disposal Units<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using your garbage disposal unit correctly can significantly extend the longevity of the system, prevent malfunctions, and eliminate potential safety issues. As an <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/areas-served\/vaughan\/bathroom-remodeling\/\">expert from Handyman Connection<\/a>, it&#8217;s my responsibility to demystify the common misconceptions about what establishes a&nbsp;suitable introduction to your garbage disposal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, large or hard items should always be avoided. Although garbage disposals are engineered to be robust, materials like bones, seeds or non-food items can cause significant damage, even leading to a&nbsp;complete breakdown.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expandable foods and hot water are a perilous combination in a garbage disposal. Pasta and rice swell when exposed to water, potentially leading to plumbing blockages. Always use cold water when running your disposal unit to solidify any fats or oils, making it easier for the unit to break them down.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, avoid cleaning products that aren&#8217;t specifically made for garbage disposal units. Harsh chemicals and bleach can corrode the metal components of your disposal, while abrasive cleaning items could scratch or damage the grinding components. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By knowing what should not go into your garbage disposal, you can effectively extend its life and maintain the overall health of your plumbing system. Understanding these items and practicing safe disposal habits are key to minimizing maintenance needs and potential repair costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhering to these guidelines can help prevent costly repairs and untimely breakdowns, enabling you to use your kitchen disposal unit safely and effectively for years to come. Remember, should you encounter any difficulties, the skilled plumbers at Handyman Connection are always available to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Choose Handyman Connection for Plumbing Repair in Vaughan<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Handyman Connection, we take pride in our top-tier <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/areas-served\/\">plumbing repair services in Vaughan<\/a>.

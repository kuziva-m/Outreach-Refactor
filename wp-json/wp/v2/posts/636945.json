The right design can optimize your storage space, organize your home and even reduce stress. Of course, to get the most out of these changes, you must first determine your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have trouble finding items when you require them? Do you have possessions that don&#8217;t seem to fit your home&#8217;s decor? Do you feel there just isn&#8217;t enough space for everything you own? If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these questions, we have the perfect decor fixes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Choose Smart Storage Furniture<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have much space, smart storage furniture can be a lifesaver. These pieces pull double-duty as comfy places to sit and subtle storage units. For example, hollow ottomans are excellent places to tuck pillows, board games and blankets when not in use. You can also find couches with space under the cushions perfect for holding sheets and towels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffee tables are another, more affordable smart storage option. They&#8217;re perfect for holding placemats, TV trays and coasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use bookcases for multitasking. For example, if you want to designate different areas in an open-concept layout, you can arrange bookshelves as room dividers. Modular bookshelves are excellent for this since you can make them as large as you like. You can even customize them to fit strangely shaped corners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Utilize Vertical Space<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have empty wall space, you have the perfect opportunity for storage. Vertical space is often forgotten about when the subject of storage comes up, but there are plenty of decor options that help you utilize these otherwise wasted areas. For example, you can install hooks near your front door so guests can hang items:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Jackets<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Purses<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Hats<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Keys<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also create vertical storage for crafting or mechanical tools. Pegboards are excellent for this, as they have adequate space for large and strangely shaped objects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Floating shelves are another great use of wall space. They can display knickknacks, books and photos while leaving room for other furniture. If you need something a little sturdier, you can install recessed shelves, as they can support more weight but don&#8217;t infringe on living space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Invest in Clear Containers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear plastic or glass containers make it easy to find precisely what you need with a glance. Since you can see the contents, you don&#8217;t have to painstakingly label each container, saving you time and money. You can also see when something runs low, so you&#8217;re never taken by surprise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, coloured containers have their place. Some foods expire quicker when exposed to sunlight, so they should be stored in opaque containers. You can also avoid this issue by placing clear containers in a dark, cool place, such as a pantry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you should think about how to optimize shelf space when buying your clear containers. Square, stackable models are best for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Buy Closed Storage Systems<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things, such as spare cables or linens, aren&#8217;t meant to be out in the open. They&#8217;re better stored in closed systems such as closets or cabinets. That way, they&#8217;re protected from dust that can clog their ports or sunlight that can fade their fabric. Your home may also look neater with these odds and ends tucked away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have much space, consider recessed cabinets. Like recessed shelves, they don&#8217;t interfere with your living space, and their doors keep their contents safe and out of sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you interested in home renovations in Vaughan?

Ventilation is especially helpful for rooms where lots of steam or moisture tends to accumulate, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. If you have ever looked into a company providing <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/what-we-do\/\">home repairs near me<\/a>, you may have seen vent installation and repair as one of their services. Here are a few reasons why good ventilation is important for bathrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>To Reduce the Likelihood of Mould and Mildew<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mould and mildew are fungi that proliferate in dark, moist and humid areas. Showers, sinks, toilets and other watery areas of the bathroom are particularly susceptible to mould and mildew growth. Mould is a serious issue because it can cause physical health symptoms, such as a runny nose, itchy eyes, coughing, wheezing, headache and difficulty breathing, in certain people. These symptoms can make it difficult for those who are sensitive to the effects of mould to perform day-to-day activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the harmful effects of these fungi, it is important to try to prevent mould and mildew from occurring in the first place by doing things such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Laundering your shower curtain, bath mats and towels regularly&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Wiping down water from the floor, tub and other surfaces after use&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Turning on the vent fan when taking a shower or using the sink for long periods of time, especially when utilizing hot water that generates steam<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keeping windows open in the bathroom when the weather is nice if you are able to do so<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the higher risk of moisture accumulation, a ventilation system should be located near the shower if possible. Working with a <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/plumbing\/\">Vaughan plumbing<\/a> company to ensure proper bathroom ventilation goes a long way toward keeping mould and mildew at bay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>To Lessen Condensation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Condensation occurs when warm, humid air, such as that in a bathroom, collects on cooler surfaces like a mirror or walls. A proper ventilation system provides airflow and lessens the chances that condensation will build up in your bathroom. This is important because, over time, condensation can lead to the warping of paint, wallpaper and the wooden frames surrounding the windows. Condensation can also lead to mould and mildew, leaving you to deal with the health effects surrounding those substances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides potentially causing damage to items in the bathroom, condensation can simply be annoying. When there is water settling on the mirrors and windows, it makes it so you cannot see into or out of those features. In addition to ensuring that you have a good ventilation system, you can do things such as using a dehumidifier and taking cooler showers to lessen the effects of condensation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>To Keep the Bathroom Fresh<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the size of your bathroom, ventilation helps keep the space fresh and in good shape. Besides helping to prevent mould, mildew and excess condensation, proper ventilation also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helps to transport and prevent the buildup of odours in the room<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Reduces the amount of dust and other fine particles in the air&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Provides warmth if you purchase a ventilation system with a built-in heater<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventilation helps improve the air quality in the bathroom and surrounding areas of the house. A good system turns a humid, stuffy bathroom into one that feels and smells fresh, clean and inviting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Looking for <\/strong><strong>Home Repairs Near Me<\/strong><strong>?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel your ventilation system is not up to par, get in touch with <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/\">Handyman Connection<\/a> for your Vaughan plumbing services.

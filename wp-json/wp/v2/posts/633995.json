As the fall enters, it is time to consider maintenance and <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/deck-repair-and-installation\/\">deck repair services in Vaughan<\/a>. If you are like most deck owners, you spend a lot of time treading across the wood surface, carrying drinks and plates of meat. The season is fun and entertaining, but it can also be abusive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fall is no different. You will probably get a lot of use out of your deck over the next couple of months, but the dirt and grime come with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the fall is coming to a close, and it is time to put away outdoor furniture and grills, take the time to clean and assess your deck. Repairing the damage and cleaning the surface now ensures that opening the deck will not be as labour-intensive next spring and summer. Handymen talk about four steps for deck cleaning and maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Clean Off Dirt and Grime<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dirt and grime are common occurrences through the summer and fall. Wood decks tend to collect debris because of the grooves on the surface. In addition to collecting dirt and muck, decks collect a lot of leaves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to clean the surface of your deck in late fall after the leaves have fallen. Use a power washer to remove all the muck collected over the past several months. You can find cleaning solutions to help wash away any tough stains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not clean the deck in the fall, letting all the grime sit until next summer, you will end up with bad staining and set in dirt. Set in debris and stains are challenging to remove, even with a pressure washer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Inspect for Rot and Decay<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the deck&#8217;s surface is clean, look for signs of rot and decay. If you used the proper decking materials, rot should be minimal. Still, wood is not invincible and does not last forever. You will need to replace boards occasionally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Signs of rot and decay include spongy or bouncy surfaces, creaky noises, water damage spots, or peeling sealant. If you come across a rotted board, remove it and inspect the joist underneath for damage, including mildew, mould, wood rot, or insect damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Assess for Shaky Posts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deck railings are integral components of a safe deck. Unfortunately, like all other deck parts, they are prone to wear and degradation. You should inspect the railing posts for signs of weakness at the beginning and end of every season. If the post is shaky, check the connection point to see if it is a loose bolt or rot. As with deck boards, if the issue results from rot or decay, remove the post and inspect the joist and beams before replacing them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Look for Raised Nails<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common issue with wood decks is raised nails. The contraction and expansion of wood naturally cause nails to lift away from the decking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another possible cause of raised nails is uneven settling or shifting of the deck. If the deck is moving, it is a concern, and you should contact a professional contractor for assistance. Warped deck boards can also pull nails away from the joists. Proper deck installation should minimize the appearance of raised nails and other common decking issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caring for your deck often requires the help of repair and painting services in Vaughan. While many homeowners may feel equipped to handle a DIY deck installation, more often than not, it results in issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you preparing to install a deck, or are you looking to clean one and repair it for the upcoming winter season?

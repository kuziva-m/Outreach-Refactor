Modern toilets are not only an upgrade from your old toilet, but they are also much more water-efficient. Contacting <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/plumbing\/\">plumbing services in Vaughan<\/a> can help you replace your toilet. Here are some signs that you need a replacement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>You&#8217;re Constantly Repairing Your Toilet<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While some toilet problems can be fixed with a quick renovation, constantly <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/maintenance\/\">repairing your toilet<\/a> may be a sign of a bigger problem. In this case, the best solution is to replace your toilet. Not only will this solve your problem much quicker, but it can save you money on costly repairs. Hiring a professional to install a new toilet can give you the peace of mind that you won&#8217;t need to spend money on repairs in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Toilet Is Cracked<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Toilets are made of porcelain, which unfortunately cracks easily. While you may think that a small crack isn&#8217;t a big deal, it can easily turn into a large flood of water. Therefore, if you spot a crack, it&#8217;s best to address it as soon as possible to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t turn into a much bigger issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, a hairline crack located at the trap means that your toilet bowl will always be empty. If your toilet bowl is cracked, you may find that water will pool around the base or that your basement ceiling is damp. If this is the case, replacing your toilet is the easiest way to prevent further issues from occurring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Toilet Uses Too Much Water<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that modern toilets only use about 0.8 gallons of water per flush? On the other hand, older toilets can use up to 5 gallons per flush. In addition to increasing your water bill, toilets with high water consumption are bad for the environment, as they can shrink fossil fuel resources and decrease air quality. In fact, some states, such as Texas and California, don&#8217;t sell toilets that use more than 1.28 gallons per flush. Consider opting for a dual-flush toilet, which has a separate flushing option for liquid waste that uses significantly less water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Toilet Is Stained<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how well you clean your toilet, it will begin to stain after years of use due to mineral deposits found in the water. You may also find that your toilet is scratched, which can occur during snaking. While minor issues like hard water stains and brown toilet rings can be removed, more serious signs of damage can&#8217;t be fixed and should be addressed by replacing the toilet entirely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Toilet Isn&#8217;t Comfortable<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Older toilets were made with a round-front bowl and standard height. However, this can be uncomfortable for elderly or tall people. You should replace your toilet with one that contains a more elongated bowl and seat as well as a taller height. Comfort height toilets, also known as ADA toilets, are typically 17 to 19 inches high.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Plumbing Services in Vaughan Can Help<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can repair minor toilet issues on your own, replacing your toilet can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Therefore, the quickest and most effective way to get the job done is to enlist the help of a skilled professional. At Handyman Connection, we&#8217;re your top source for all of your plumbing needs.

While you are probably at least passingly familiar with supply lines and drain lines, you may not be as familiar with vent pipes. Nevertheless, this little-known and often misunderstood component has a critical role to play in your home plumbing system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Purpose of a Vent Pipe?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Supply lines carry water to your home, allowing you to fill up sinks and tubs, take a shower, flush your toilet, and run your washing machine and similar large appliances. Once you are done with any of these tasks, drain pipes empty the wastewater from your home into the sewers. A vent pipe is a third type of plumbing line, but instead of carrying water, it regulates the flow of air. This is necessary for your plumbing system to work properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Benefits Does a Vent Pipe Offer?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A vent pipe offers two main benefits. The first is that it removes sewer gases from your home. The decomposition of organic matter in wastewater produces sewer gases as a byproduct. These foul-smelling gases can sometimes flow from the sewer system into your home, but the vent pipe provides a route by which they can escape. The vent pipe is installed in the roof, away from windows and air conditioning systems, so the gases do not get back inside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drain pipes have to maintain a certain level of air pressure to function properly. If the air pressure level drops, the drainage could slow or stop completely due to the formation of a vacuum in the system. Another benefit of the vent pipe is that it helps to maintain a constant air pressure level in the drainage system of your home to keep it functioning properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Problems Can Arise From a Vent Pipe?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the vent pipe gets blocked, it can affect the function of your home&#8217;s drainage system because of a negative pressure buildup. If this happens, you may notice drainage becoming much slower and hear gurgling sounds from the drains. Tubs and sinks may have standing water that you cannot get rid of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blocked vent pipe can also allow sewer gases to build up in your home. Ammonia and hydrogen sulphide can be toxic to humans when inhaled in sufficient quantities, while large amounts of methane are flammable. Because these gases also give off foul odours, you typically become aware of the problem right away. If you smell sewer gases in your home, you should call plumbing services in Vaughan right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sediment can form in drainage pipes that back up frequently. While it is possible for the sediment to be removed, the repairs can be extremely costly. Therefore, it is best to address a problem with the vent pipe immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Causes Blockages in Vent Pipes?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because vent pipes are on the roof, they are fairly inaccessible. However, there are ways that they can get clogged. A baseball or tennis ball that is struck or thrown high enough to reach the roof could get stuck in the vent pipe. If you have tall trees next to the house, debris such as small branches or leaves can fall into the vent pipe and get stuck. Birds may build their nests on a vent pipe, or small rodents may try to crawl into one to gain access to your home and die there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Should You Call Handyman Connection for Plumbing Services in Vaughan?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vent pipe blockages are beyond the capability of most homeowners to deal with on their own.

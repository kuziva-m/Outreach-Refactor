Imagine a day without one\u2014it wouldn&#8217;t be easy! Sometimes, a toilet might need to be replaced because it\u2019s broken, it uses too much water, or you want a new style to match your bathroom. When that happens, having a reliable handyman can make the process stress-free and efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in Vaughan and dealing with a troublesome toilet, Handyman Connection is here to help. We offer <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/plumbing\/\">excellent plumbing services<\/a>, making toilet replacement a breeze.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide will show you step-by-step how to replace a toilet with the help of a skilled handyman. We\u2019ll cover everything from removing the old toilet to installing a brand-new one. Plus, you&#8217;ll learn some tips and tricks used by professionals in Vaughan to ensure everything works perfectly.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let\u2019s dive in and explore how the experts get the job done!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reasons to Replace a Toilet&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you might need to swap out your old toilet for a new one. Here are some reasons why a change could be beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about leaks. If you notice water on the <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-a-new-floor-installation\/\">floor<\/a> around your toilet or hear the sound of running water, you likely have a leak. Not only does this waste water, but it can also increase your water bill. Fixing these leaks is important to save money and water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up are cracks in the porcelain. These are not just ugly; they can also lead to water damage on your bathroom floor. If you spot any cracks, it might be time to get a new toilet before it leads to bigger issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason is frequent repairs. If you find yourself fixing your toilet more often than not, it might be cheaper in the long run to just get a new one. Constant repairs can be frustrating, and a new toilet could be a simpler solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you may have an outdated toilet. Old models use more water and might not look as nice as newer styles. Updating your <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/incorporating-classic-styles-into-modern-bathroom-remodels\/\">bathroom with a modern<\/a> toilet can make it more efficient and stylish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, think about comfort. Newer toilets come in various heights and styles that can make using the bathroom more comfortable for everyone in your house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>General Overview of Replacing a Toilet&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious about how the installation is done? The process involves several methodical steps to ensure everything works perfectly by the end. Here is how a professional, like <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/\">Handyman Connection in Vaughan<\/a>, approaches a toilet replacement.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 1: Shut Off the Water Supply&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is turning off the water supply and draining the existing toilet. This ensures that no water remains in the bowl or tank, minimizing spills during the removal process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 2: Remove the Old Toilet&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, the bolts and wax seal securing the old toilet are carefully removed. Any leftover residue is cleaned off to create a smooth surface for the new installation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/02\/Replacing-a-Toilet.jpg\" alt=\"General Overview of Replacing a Toilet\" class=\"wp-image-705406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/02\/Replacing-a-Toilet.jpg 750w, https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/02\/Replacing-a-Toilet-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 3: Prepare the Area&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing the area includes levelling the surface and ensuring the flange (the part that connects the toilet to the plumbing) is in good condition. If needed, the flange or parts of the flooring may be updated during this step.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 4: Place and Secure the New Toilet&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new toilet is installed by positioning it over the flange and firmly securing it with bolts. A new wax ring is applied to ensure a watertight seal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 5: Reconnect the Water Supply&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the water supply is reconnected, and the toilet is tested for leaks. This last step ensures everything is up and running smoothly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this might sound simple, there\u2019s plenty that can go wrong without proper expertise and the right tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Can Go Wrong When Replacing a Toilet Yourself?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing a toilet might sound easy, but it can be tricky. If things don&#8217;t go just right, you might end up with problems. Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/common-mistakes-made-when-diy-painting\/\">common mistakes<\/a> and what they mean:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improper Sealing<\/strong>: If the wax ring isn&#8217;t placed correctly, water can leak onto your floor. This can damage your floor and might make repairs more expensive later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Uneven Installation<\/strong>: If the toilet isn&#8217;t level, it might rock or even crack after some time. It&#8217;s essential to make sure everything is even during the setup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Damaging Pipes<\/strong>: Be careful not to overtighten bolts. Doing so can crack the pipes, and fixing them can be costly. Handle everything gently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Water Supply Issues<\/strong>: If the water line isn&#8217;t hooked up right, it can either leak or give you weak water pressure. Double-check connections to avoid these issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Waste of Time and Resources<\/strong>: Running back and forth to the hardware store or getting the wrong parts can eat up your time and money. Planning and knowing what you need in advance helps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These mistakes show that replacing a toilet can be a bit of a challenge. It might be worth asking an expert for help to make sure everything goes smoothly, and your bathroom stays in <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/keeping-your-drywall-in-top-shape-year-round-seasonal-tips\/\">top shape<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Hire a Professional?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to putting in a new toilet, letting an expert handle it is the smart choice. Professionals know what they&#8217;re doing and can make sure it&#8217;s done right the first time, saving you from headaches and extra costs later on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they make sure everything is set up perfectly so you don&#8217;t end up with leaks or other problems. This means you won&#8217;t have to spend extra money fixing mistakes. Next, they handle the whole process efficiently, which saves you time and effort. Instead of stressing over each step, you can sit back, knowing it&#8217;s in good hands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, a professional installation promises a long-lasting, well-functioning toilet. You can trust their work to last, so you get peace of mind along with your new setup. With their help, you can have a comfortable and reliable bathroom without any hassle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leave It to the Experts at Handyman Connection in Vaughan&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Replacing a toilet might seem easy at first, but just one little mistake can lead to big problems like leaks or flooding.

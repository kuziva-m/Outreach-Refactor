Extensive work often requires drywall taping, an essential step people outside the construction industry may not be familiar with. Knowing more about the process can help you make sound decisions about materials, hiring professionals and final design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Benefits of Drywall Taping<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about what drywall actually is and why it&#8217;s popular in construction. While the exterior walls may be made of brick, concrete block, wood and other hardy materials, most residences have a thin layer of drywall applied to the ceilings and interior walls. About a quarter-inch thick, this layer is made of two paper boards with a sheet of gypsum in between. Once the boards are screwed into place, they&#8217;re covered by a layer of plaster that hardens. You may hear the resulting surface called different names:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sheetrock<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Custard boards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Wall-board<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Buster boards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gypsum panels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since gypsum board comes in panels, there will be seams where multiple boards touch. Even when boards are flush, these areas present a weakness in the wall and may be difficult to plaster over. That&#8217;s where drywall taping comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drywall tape seals these seams, creating a smooth surface that&#8217;s easier to work with. It also reinforces the weak area, helping the drywall last longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Drywall Taping Process<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the taping process may seem straightforward, it requires a high level of skill to do correctly. In addition to sealing joints between flat panels, the tape is used in corners where walls and ceiling meet. Poorly applied tape means an uneven plaster layer, which can look slapdash. Since most renovations aim to increase the home value, poorly done drywall work can be problematic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The taping process (and drywall installation in general) can also get messy. The plaster (also known as compound or mud) takes a minimum of 24 hours to dry completely. That means there&#8217;s a risk of drips, especially if the layer is particularly thick. Automated tools can keep applications even, but you still need coverings to protect the floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Advantages of Hiring Professionals<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring professionals for drywall repairs in Vaughan means free time and peace of mind for homeowners. Sheetrock experts know all the best tricks to ensure long-lasting results, and they own professional-grade tools for the job. Tackling drywall yourself can be gruelling, especially if you&#8217;re not used to physical labor, and take much longer than a professional team would need. The experts have years of experience and proper technique, which come in handy if the project runs into unexpected issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing the wall-board correctly is critical \u2014 not just because a sloppy job looks terrible, but because sheetrock offers safety benefits. For example, drywall acts as a firebreak since it&#8217;s made of fire-resistant materials. Should a housefire occur, the gypsum board will slow the spread, allowing first responders more time to save your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drywall is also insulating, which can lower your energy will. Additionally, it&#8217;s moisture-resistant, reducing the risk of mould growing inside your walls and causing health issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, plaster provides wall texture. Professionals know how to achieve specific texture effects, allowing you to customize your decor:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Smooth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Lace<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rosebud<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Machine brocade<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Orange peel<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Slap brush<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Venitian<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Popcorn<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Knockdown<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Handyman Connection Experience<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next time you need drywall repair, save yourself a headache by hiring Handyman Connection.

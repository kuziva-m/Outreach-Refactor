If you have a busy family, the kitchen and bathroom sinks are constantly getting heavy use. You need to be able to rely on your kitchen and bathroom plumbing and trust that your fixtures can keep up with your family\u2019s habits and use. At Handyman Connection, we provide fast <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/plumbing\/\">plumbing services in Vaughan<\/a> so you don\u2019t have to be inconvenienced by broken components. Here are four signs you may need to get your faucets repaired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Damaged Components<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first signs you need to get your faucet repaired is if there are damaged components. Faucets are comprised of multiple small parts that can sometimes deteriorate over time. When a faucet is older, one or more of its components may start to loosen or break off, creating problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faucet parts like the washer, o-ring, the seal, valve or the handle can become damaged if the components are more than 10 years old. Additionally, if your water is hard or you have sediment in your water, your components may wear out more often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Strange Noises<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound your faucet makes may also indicate a potential problem. A normal, functioning faucet should not emit any strange noises. If you notice any weird noises coming out of your faucets, you should give our team a call to come and check it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common noise that indicates something is wrong is a screeching sound coming from the faucet when using it. This may be a clue that the washer needs to be replaced. Other noises that may be signs of an issue are clanking or clicking. For these sounds, a pro can come out and diagnose and solve the mystery noise with a faucet repair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Rust and Mineral Deposits<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your faucets may also show signs of buildup, which could indicate problems with their function. Your water may leave behind rust, mineral, calcium and lime stains or deposits on the components. If you have hard water, this is more common.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeowners can help prevent the buildup from impacting their faucet\u2019s functioning by regularly cleaning the deposits off of the faucet. You can use vinegar, baking soda, lemon or commercial cleaning solutions for mineral deposits to clear away the stains. You may need to call in a technician from our team to reach other parts of the faucet that are not accessible unless it\u2019s taken apart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Squeaky Faucet Handles<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Squeaky faucet handles may also need to be repaired. The most common reason for a squeaky faucet handle is wear and tear on the stem of the handle. To fix this, you may need to replace the entire faucet or have a plumber apply the plumber\u2019s grease to the component.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A plumber can also recommend a faucet handle that will be more durable for your family\u2019s lifestyle and usage. You can also get customized product and plumbing fixture recommendations based on the type of water you have in your pipes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quality <\/strong><strong>Plumbing Services in Vaughan&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important for your plumbing fixtures to be reliable and durable for your daily kitchen and bathroom use.

Your basement can be redesigned to help control your home&#8217;s clutter and keep everything in its place. The team at Handyman Connection offers unique <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/storage\/\">storage solutions in Vaughan<\/a> that can help you stay more organized. Here are some ideas to help you maximize your basement space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design a Cubby System<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways you can create a simple and efficient organizational system for your basement is to have cubbies added to your walls. A cubby shelving system can be conveniently placed against any basement walls and adds tons of storage options to your basement. Games, kids&#8217; toys, shoes, plastic containers, seasonal d\u00e9cor and old clothes can be stored in a cubby system. The cubby area keeps the items out of the way, freeing up your basement space for other uses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hang Bigger Items<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next easy way you can instantly get more storage space in your basement is with hooks. If you have bikes, scooters and other big items piling up in the corner of your basement, you can start using your ceiling space to clear up the floor and get more room. We can help you by installing heavy-duty hooks on the ceiling so these items can be stowed out of the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create Storage Spots in Empty Spaces<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also possible to reconfigure some spots with home renovations that target empty spaces. The basement may be full of various empty spots that aren&#8217;t being utilized effectively. You can add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hgtv.ca\/renovations\/photos\/renovate-space-under-your-stairs-1931402\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">storage solutions under the stairs<\/a>, in crawl spaces, next to corners, inside of small closets, in the laundry room, behind doors and in the mudroom. Instead of wasting these unused spaces, you can maximize your basement square footage and get more out of your layout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add Built-In Shelving<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Built-in shelves are also a great addition to a basement space that is used for recreation, gaming or an extra bedroom. Our team can design a custom built-in shelving system that can manage your extra items. Consider putting in bookshelves, new cabinets or drawers to handle the clutter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Repurpose Old Cabinets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you recently renovated your kitchen or bathroom and have extra cabinets, consider putting them in the basement to add a cost-effective storage option. Old kitchen cabinets make a great place to store board games, blankets, toys, family pictures, pet supplies or sports equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Plastic Bins<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plastic bins are also a convenient and easy way to stow clothes and seasonal decorations. Winter jackets, summer clothes, ski gear, baby clothes and special occasion wear can be folded and put in plastic bins to keep them fresh and clean for years. The bins protect against any damage from pests, moisture or dust that may be in your basement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Put Up a Pegboard<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you keep tools and hardware in your basement, one way to keep everything in its place is with a pegboard system. All you need to do is install a pegboard against one of your walls in the basement and then add tools, nails, screws, equipment and home repair supplies to the setup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better Storage Solutions in Vaughan<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s common to have too much stuff and not enough space to keep it organized. If your basement has turned into a disorganized mess, we can help you reconfigure the layout and maximize your space. A complete organizational system can help you know where everything is and get more use out of your basement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to reclaim your basement space?

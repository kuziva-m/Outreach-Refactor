By using an accessible open floor plan design, you can create a space that feels open, welcoming, and easy to move around in. A layout like this is perfect for anyone with limited mobility, whether they use a wheelchair, walker, or just need more space for comfort.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this sounds like what you\u2019re looking for, <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/areas-served\/\">Handyman Connection in Vaughan<\/a> can help bring these ideas to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making your home mobility-friendly is all about smart planning. Wide, open spaces and thoughtful details can make your home more functional without losing that cozy, personal touch. From widening hallways to the best flooring choices, we\u2019ll walk you through practical tips to create a home that works for everyone. These inclusive living space ideas blend style with usability!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make Pathways Wider<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to a <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/remodeling\/\">mobility-friendly home<\/a> layout is ensuring every pathway is wide enough. Narrow hallways or crowded rooms can make it hard to move freely, especially with mobility aids like wheelchairs or walkers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep pathways at least 36 inches wide, and go up to 48 inches if more space is needed for larger equipment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Doorways should also be at least 32 inches wide for easier access.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Arrange your furniture to create clear paths. Avoid cramming too many items into one room.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Need help with adjustments like widening doors or removing small walls? Handyman Connection in Vaughan can handle these projects professionally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Choose-Mobility-Friendly-Flooring.jpg\" alt=\"Choose Mobility-Friendly Flooring\" class=\"wp-image-715989\" srcset=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Choose-Mobility-Friendly-Flooring.jpg 750w, https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Choose-Mobility-Friendly-Flooring-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Choose Mobility-Friendly Flooring<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of flooring you choose can make a big difference in how easy it is to move around your home. Some materials, like thick carpets or slippery tiles, can cause tripping hazards or make it harder to use mobility aids. That\u2019s why smooth surfaces like hardwood, laminate, vinyl, or tile are excellent options. These materials create an even foundation that&#8217;s both safe and easy to maintain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019d like to add some warmth to your space with area rugs, make sure they have a non-slip backing to keep them securely in place. This prevents any accidental slipping while still giving your home a cozy touch. With a little thoughtful planning, you can find flooring that\u2019s safe, functional, and stylish.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Arrange Furniture Thoughtfully<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Furniture placement can make or break an accessible open floor plan design. Cluttered or awkward furniture arrangements block pathways and make it harder to move around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Leave enough space between pieces of furniture to allow easy movement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose couches and chairs with arms to make sitting and standing easier.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Consider adjustable or modular furniture that can be rearranged as needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping your layout simple and clear will ensure everyone feels comfortable in the space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Update-the-Kitchen-for-Accessibility.jpg\" alt=\"Update the Kitchen for Accessibility\" class=\"wp-image-715990\" srcset=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Update-the-Kitchen-for-Accessibility.jpg 750w, https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Update-the-Kitchen-for-Accessibility-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Update the Kitchen for Accessibility<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchens are central to most homes, so making them mobility-friendly is essential. Small updates can make cooking and cleaning up much easier for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some ideas for making your kitchen accessible:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Lower countertops or adjustable counters that are easier to reach.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pull-out drawers and shelves that reduce the need to bend or stretch.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Appliances like side-opening ovens or countertop microwaves for easy access.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lever-style faucet handles that are simpler to use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget about good lighting! Bright kitchens are not only cheerful but also make cooking or cleaning safer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create Safe and Easy-to-Use Bathrooms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bathrooms are often not designed with accessibility in mind, but a few changes can make a huge difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider these upgrades for a more functional bathroom:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Put grab bars near the toilet and in the shower for extra support.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use zero-threshold showers so there\u2019s no step to get in.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add handheld showerheads that work for people sitting or standing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set sinks at a height that works for everyone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use slip-resistant tiles or finishes to avoid falls.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes can help make the bathroom safer and easier to use for anyone in your family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Add-Smart-Storage.jpg\" alt=\"Add Smart Storage\" class=\"wp-image-715988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Add-Smart-Storage.jpg 750w, https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/51\/2025\/06\/Add-Smart-Storage-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add Smart Storage<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping your home tidy is an important part of making sure it\u2019s easy to move around, especially in an open floor plan. Choose <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/closet-storage-solutions-transitioning-from-summer-to-fall\/\">storage solutions<\/a> that are simple and accessible for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Storage ideas for your home:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add pull-down shelves in closets to bring items within reach.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use open shelving in the kitchen, <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/3-ways-to-repurpose-your-living-room\/\">living room<\/a>, or bedroom for everyday items.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include drawers or cabinets at lower heights instead of high shelves.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build storage into hallways or entryways to keep things out of the way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart storage doesn\u2019t just make your home easier to use; it also keeps it looking clean and organized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Improve Lighting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighting is an often overlooked part of a mobility-friendly home layout. Bright, layered lighting helps people see obstacles and makes the space feel more welcoming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tips for better lighting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use LED bulbs for energy savings and a long-lasting glow.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add motion-sensor lighting in hallways and entrances for safety.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install adjustable blinds to easily control natural lighting during the day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-lit home is not only practical but also creates a warm and positive atmosphere for your family and guests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Adjust Heights of Everyday Features<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Switches, outlets, and thermostats often go unnoticed when thinking about accessibility, but adjusting their height can make a big difference in how easy your home is to use. By placing these features at the right level, you ensure everyone, whether standing or sitting, can reach them comfortably. Ideally, <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/the-best-spots-for-light-switches-around-your-home\/\">light switches<\/a> and thermostats should sit about 30 to 48 inches off the floor. This makes them easy to use without stretching or bending.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For outlets, lowering those that are too high or adding new ones in accessible locations can help improve convenience and functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Remove Any Barriers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes the smallest changes can make the biggest difference in creating a more accessible home. Obstacles like old rugs, high door thresholds, or random clutter might seem minor, but they can quickly become mobility challenges. Removing these items can instantly improve movement around your home and reduce the risk of tripping. It\u2019s also a good idea to smooth out transitions between different types of flooring. This ensures there aren\u2019t any bumps or uneven surfaces that could make navigating your space tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open floor plans naturally help reduce barriers, offering wide, clear spaces that encourage easy movement. If your current layout has unnecessary walls or tight areas that limit accessibility, we\u2019re ready to help. At Handyman Connection in Vaughan, our team has the skills and experience to tackle these kinds of adjustments. Whether it\u2019s removing a wall or reworking a tricky area, we\u2019ll do the heavy lifting to make your home more accessible and welcoming for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build a Home That Everyone Loves<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An accessible open <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-a-new-floor-installation\/\">floor plan design helps to create a home<\/a> where style and usability come together.

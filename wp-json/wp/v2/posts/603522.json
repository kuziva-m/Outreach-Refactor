Though valued for its versatility, low cost, and sturdiness, drywall does have its disadvantages. One of the biggest disadvantages is that it doesn&#8217;t stand up well to moisture. If it gets soaked, the damage can be so significant that you require professional drywall services in Vaughan to replace it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Happens to Drywall When It Gets Wet?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drywall consists primarily of two materials. The interior panel is made out of gypsum, while the exterior covering is made of thick paper. Gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral. If you were to remove the paper covering on a sheet of drywall, you would see a white rock with a somewhat chalky consistency. Gypsum is a relatively soft material that can be scratched with a coin or a fingernail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the gypsum panels and the paper that covers them are porous materials, meaning that they have the ability to soak up water. If a painted or papered drywall panel is splashed with water, it usually will not soak in. However, if drywall is exposed to large amounts of water, you may see the following types of damage:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Staining<\/strong>: Drywall that is exposed to water will usually be discoloured<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Breakdown<\/strong>: Prolonged exposure to water, especially in large quantities, will cause the saturated gypsum to start breaking down and losing its integrity. If it doesn&#8217;t collapse entirely, which is certainly possible, it will bulge, warp, or sag.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>Contamination<\/strong>: The porous materials used in drywall will soak up not only the water but anything it contains as well. For example, if the water is contaminated with sewage, the drywall will also absorb the bacteria it contains.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"4\"><li><strong>Mould Growth<\/strong>: Exposure to water may activate dormant mould spores and cause them to start growing in the drywall. This can happen over time or with acute exposure. At first, the drywall may appear otherwise unaffected, but as the mould growth progresses, dark spots may start to occur. As long as the mould growth remains superficial, it may be possible to decontaminate it. However, once it reaches the gypsum, there is little you can do about the contamination besides replacing the entire panel.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Does Drywall Get Wet?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a leak in the roof, the water can get down into the drywall. If this occurs, you may see discolouration and warping of the ceiling and high up along the walls. Another common cause of wet drywall is flooding, in which case the damage is more likely to occur along the bottom of the walls near the floor where the porous materials soak up the water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Should You Hire Professionals To Replace Drywall?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drywall replacement does not affect your home&#8217;s structure. It is a covering for the home&#8217;s framework and is not load-bearing on its own. Because of this, you may think that you can replace the drywall yourself. You may be right, but there are advantages to hiring a professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to home repairs, it is good to avoid doing more than you need to do. A professional can replace a single panel of drywall and then match it perfectly to the undamaged panels that remain. If you were to attempt to do it yourself, you might not be able to match it adequately and may have to redo the entire wall as a result. That being the case, hiring professionals to replace the damaged panel can save you money in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Drywall Services in Vaughan From Handyman Connection<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When there is water damage to drywall, replacement is usually the only option.

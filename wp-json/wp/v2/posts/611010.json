Some older houses do not even have fans for ventilation in the bathroom. However, they are a necessity in newer homes that are more highly insulated. When the home is practically airtight, indoor air quality depends on mechanical ventilation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is a Bathroom Ventilation Fan?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A ventilation fan is usually installed in the ceiling of the bathroom and connected to the exterior of the house via ductwork. When turned on, it pulls air out of the room and sends it outside. If the room is very humid, the exhaust fan helps remove excess moisture from the air. If it is contaminated by foul-smelling pollutants, the fan helps to vent these to the outside as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Can Happen if You Don&#8217;t Have a Ventilation Fan?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Excess moisture can lead to property damage and health issues. Metallic fixtures can rust, doors can warp, wallpaper and paint can peel or crack, and wallboard can be ruined because of prolonged exposure. Furthermore, high humidity also provides micro-organisms such as mould and mildew the perfect chance to breed. Some of these micro-organisms are pathogens, meaning that they can cause disease. Others are allergens meaning that, although they do not cause infection, sometimes the body perceives them as potential threats and produces an allergic reaction as an immune response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Should You Look for When Purchasing a Bathroom Ventilation Fan?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for a fan that has been certified by the Home Ventilating Institute. While non-certified exhaust fans may bear inflated performance ratings to try to boost sales, HVI-Certified units are confirmed to conform to industry standards through independent testing and will perform as promised to achieve maximum indoor air quality through proper ventilation as long as it has been installed correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Else Should You Consider When Buying a Fan?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadiancontractor.ca\/canadian-contractor\/bathroom-ventilation-fact-and-fiction\/4930\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HVI-Certified ventilation fan<\/a> has to be sized appropriately to the room for full effectiveness. Ventilation is measured in cubic feet per minute, referring to the amount of air the fan can move. You generally need a fan of at least 50 CFM, but if your bathroom is larger than 50 square feet in area, you need one CFM for every square foot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The height of the bathroom ceiling also makes a difference. If it is taller than 8 feet, you may require extra ventilation. You also need a separate, dedicated exhaust fan for an enclosed toilet. You can install a fan as close as possible to the tub or shower if it is approved for installation in wet areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the ventilation fan is sending air outside, new air has to be able to come in to replace it. Otherwise, the bathroom could turn into a vacuum. You should make sure that the door to the bathroom clears the floor by at least three-quarters of an inch to allow air to enter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue that can arise with ventilation fans is noise. Exposure to loud noise from a fan can damage hearing over time and also just be very annoying. Rather than decibels, the sound level of a bathroom fan is measured in a different unit known as sones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>0.5 Sones: Rustling leaves<\/li><li>1.0 Sones: Refrigerator humming<\/li><li>3.0 Sones: Typical office noise<\/li><li>4.0 Sones: Standard television operation<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A bathroom fan should rate no higher than 1.0 sones for quiet operation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are There Any More Options?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Basic bathroom ventilation fans operate manually in the manner described to remove moisture from the room. However, there are some that offer more advanced options. For example, some are able to turn on and off automatically because of a humidistat that detects the level of moisture in the air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Handyman Connection&#8217;s Home Repair Services in Vaughan Include Bathroom Fan Installation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A ventilation fan is an important part of bathroom renovations, especially if you are adding one to a room that didn&#8217;t have it before.

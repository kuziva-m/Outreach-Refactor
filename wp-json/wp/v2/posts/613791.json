If you have more than one panel, the additional panels are known as subpanels. Find out why you may have a subpanel, the benefits of these electrical upgrades and some signs that you may need to contact an <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/electrical\/\">electrician in Vaughan<\/a> for repair services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Electrical Subpanel Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic design of a subpanel is the same as your main service panel, but these smaller panels are only powered by a 240-volt breaker and don\u2019t have as many separate breakers. These breakers separate circuits and can be used to power outlets, lights and appliances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The size of your subpanel is determined by your electrical need and by the size of your existing electrical service. If your home only has a line running to it capable of 100 amps, then you\u2019ll need to work with your local power company before you can install a 200-amp main panel. A 200-amp panel is necessary if you wish to put in a 100-amp subpanel, for example, while a 100-amp main panel may be all you need if you only wish to install a 60-amp subpanel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Uses of an Electrical Subpanel<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Subpanels offer convenient power, efficient electrical line installation and more space in your main service panel. It\u2019s convenient because you don\u2019t need to walk all the way to your main breaker panel if a breaker trips in your garage or outbuilding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason a subpanel can make a new installation more efficient is that you have to run fewer wires a long distance. If you have a detached storage building or garage, then a subpanel prevents you from running several wires from the panel all the way out to the separate structure\u2019s outlets and lights. This saves time, space and money by reducing the number of long wire runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An electrical service panel only has so much room for additional circuits. If you\u2019re running low on space in your panel, then you can expand your circuit possibilities by taking a simple 60-amp breaker slot and powering an entire subpanel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Locations for Subpanels<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most subpanels are used to provide convenient electrical service to separate buildings. You can also use a subpanel to increase the number of breakers available near your main service panel, but it may be more convenient to simply replace your main panel with a larger one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work with an experienced contractor before you make any decisions about subpanel placement. These panels carry a dangerous amount of electricity and require electrical experience to safely install.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Signs You Need a Subpanel Repair or Installation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding a subpanel is a common project if you\u2019re looking to expand your electrical system in your home. If you wish to add an electric heater, more outlets or an appliance to a garage or barn, it may be time to contact an electrician in Vaughan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/common-reasons-your-oulet-is-smoking\/\">common reason to contact an electrician<\/a> is if you\u2019re having issues with your subpanel. Here are some common issues that may require a professional repair or installation project:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You wish to add outlets or lights to an outbuilding<\/li><li>Your breakers trip frequently<\/li><li>You have a fuse subpanel<\/li><li>Your subpanel uses old wiring<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A qualified electrician can make sure you choose the right size subpanel to not overload your main service panel or under-power your electrical needs. A local professional can also inspect your wiring to see if you have any aluminum wiring or other outdated wires that need to be replaced for your safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Request Electrical Repair Services in Vaughan<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t attempt to install or repair a subpanel by yourself.

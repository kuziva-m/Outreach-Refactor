In the kitchen, electric appliances make it easier to prepare and cook meals, but combining electricity and wet surfaces can lead to hazardous conditions. Electric shocks pose a serious risk. You can be seriously injured by an electric shock in the kitchen. Fires can also start from an electric shock. <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/electrical\/\">Electrical contractors in Vaughan<\/a> offer advice on avoiding an electrical shock in your kitchen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Don\u2019t Use Damaged Electrical Cords<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a kitchen appliance has a damaged electrical cord, replace it. Don\u2019t repair a cord or plug on your own. Even a small nick in a cord can be hazardous if the cord gets wet or if you handle the cord or plug with wet hands. Always handle electrical appliances with care. Use dry hands. Don\u2019t let children use kitchen appliances unsupervised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unplug Toaster Before Getting Food Out of It<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If something is stuck in your toaster, don\u2019t use metal forks or knives to dislodge it without unplugging the toaster. Using something metal can cause an electrical shock or even worse, a fire. The crumbs left on toasters are flammable, so it doesn\u2019t take much to start a fire. Toasters heat up to 260 degrees Celsius, so it\u2019s important to be careful when using a toaster. Some residential <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/articles\/common-reasons-your-oulet-is-smoking\/\">electricians in Vaughan<\/a> recommend unplugging a toaster when it\u2019s not in use. You could also buy one with an automatic shutoff feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Avoid Electrical Devices Around the Water<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pure water acts as an insulator, but the water that comes out of your tap is rarely pure. Tap water, even when it\u2019s safe for drinking, has added minerals such as fluoride, that cause the water to conduct electricity, creating electrical shocks. In the kitchen, you shouldn\u2019t only keep plugs away from the sink. Water can create a hazard in other ways when combined with an electrical appliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Always clean up water on the floor. If you are standing on a wet surface when you unplug or plug in an appliance, it could create a shock.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use dry hands when using appliances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be careful of having wet clothes around appliances or sources of electricity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Don\u2019t use water to put out an electrical fire.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Never Use Defective Electrical Devices<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Appliances aren\u2019t the only electrical hazards in the kitchen. Light switches, outlets, lights and extension cords can also be problematic. When one of these devices is malfunctioning, contact electrical contractors Vaughan to make repairs before using them. Know where the circuit breakers are located in your home, to be able to switch them off if you notice a problem with your electrical devices. Don\u2019t switch the breaker on and off quickly, as if it was a light switch. You could damage a breaker that way. Switch the breaker off before unplugging a defective device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Avoid Using Multi-Outlets in the Kitchen<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Power bars that allow you to plug in multiple appliances are great for protecting your devices from lightning strikes or other energy surges. These power bars aren\u2019t meant to plug in multiple kitchen appliances. Avoid an electrical overload by only plugging in two appliances to each outlet. If you do use power strips, make sure to choose one that shuts off in case of a power overload.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>If You\u2019re Unsure, Contact Residential Electricians in Vaughan<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Electrical contractors in Vaughan with <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/\">Handyman Connection<\/a> offer professional electrical repair services.

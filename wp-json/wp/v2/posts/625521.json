Are crown mouldings different than trim? Or, do all three of these terms mean the same thing? If you wish to make interior home improvements involving the area surrounding your windows, nearly any time of year is a good time to begin. Learn more about three different types of window casings and get in touch with a <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/carpentry\/\">carpenter in Vaughan<\/a> to repair or renovate your windows today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are Window Casings?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A window casing is simply the box that encloses the window itself. These structures are typically made from wood and stained to look natural or painted (usually white or off-white). Some people refer to them as &#8220;trim&#8221; \u2014 but trim can also serve as a catch-all term that includes the baseboards, which run along the walls at floor height, and crown mouldings, which run along the top of the walls near the ceiling, as well. Interior casings are mounted around each window frame to give the window a more polished, elegant look.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3 Types of Window Casing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Casings aren&#8217;t just an interior design quirk: They serve the functional purpose of keeping cold air out in the wintertime and hot, humid air from entering during the summertime. Which type of casing is right for your home? Learn more about three common types you may see in Vaughan homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Complete Casing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A complete window casing is exactly what it sounds like: The window is completely surrounded by moulding material. You could choose a simple, one-layer casing that surrounds the window like a rectangle, or you may want to splurge on a larger casing with multiple layers. More elaborate casings tend to make rooms look more expensive, fancy, and ornate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Low and High Profile Casing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Low-profile casings are relatively inexpensive and they capitalize on the functional use of this type of trim. This type of flat casing doesn&#8217;t look much different from the window frame that holds the glass in place, but it does a great job of preventing the elements from getting inside your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-profile casing, in contrast, does not blend in with the surrounding walls and can be as decorative and as detailed as you like. This type of casing is a great option for larger windows, main rooms, and anywhere in your home where you want people to notice your windows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Modern Casing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have noticed that in recently built homes in the Vaughan area, windows are not elaborately adorned with high-profile casing. &#8220;Modern&#8221; casing is a low-profile, minimalistic approach to window casing as it typically does a great job of enclosing the window, but it does not draw attention to itself. The focus here is on the window itself \u2014 or the light it lets into the room \u2014 rather than the casing surrounding the window.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Connect With a Licensed <\/strong><strong>Carpenter in Vaughan<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Handyman Connection, we&#8217;ve been in the business for decades and we make it a goal to only hire handymen with at least 10 years of experience each.

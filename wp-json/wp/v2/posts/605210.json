Simply optimizing natural light and updating lighting can brighten a room without breaking the bank. Experienced electricians at Handyman Connections <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/remodeling\/\">remodelling services in Vaughan<\/a> can also handle the swapping or new installation of fixtures and lighten your living area.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Light Fixtures<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Light fixtures can provide high-quality illumination as well as being beautiful focal points. Architectural light fixtures can offer lighting features that play with shadows on ceilings and walls to enhance lighting experiences. Dated light fixtures are often guilty of being dark-coloured and having a dim, filtered output. Replace older fixtures with new, more modern light fixtures to brighten your living area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Natural Light&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Natural light is an asset that nature gifts us. That golden hour light filtering in and bathing the room in warm lighting is a homeowner\u2019s dream. The best way to ensure that your living area is illuminated is to consider these factors to optimize the natural light sources.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Window Treatments<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When choosing window treatments to optimize natural light, be sure that they are functional and beautiful. You will want to maintain privacy but also retain the filtering in of natural light. Sheer patterned drapes are an example of an easy window treatment that is flexible in colour and style but still offers natural light and privacy options. Turn blinds can also filter in natural light while providing privacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pull shades and blackout curtains, on the other hand, do provide maximum privacy but can darken a room exponentially because they prevent light from entering. Try to entertain a happy medium when choosing window treatments to lighten the space. If window treatments of the past have left you feeling nervous about leaving holes in the wall or pulling drywall out by the chunk, Handyman Connection can help install window treatments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Windows and Furniture Placement<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing the layout of a room, be sure to place furniture so that both natural light and light installations are optimized to lighten the room. Never block windows with any furniture. Refrain from choosing pieces of taller furniture near light fixtures not to block light from reaching the furthest parts of the room. Leave room for natural light from windows to penetrate through thoroughfares elongating the room.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Windows and Outdoor Greenery<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One often overlooked aspect of keeping your living area bright and light is maintaining outdoor greenery. The regular maintenance of any outdoor plants that may hinder light from reaching your lying area is essential. Handyman Connection can assess your property to create a maintenance plan that will keep your windows clear of any overgrowth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Light Bulbs&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Light bulbs aren\u2019t just 60-watt soft white bulbs for your living room anymore. Ecofriendly and long-lasting bulbs come in a wide variety of lumens and bulb colours. Ranging from amber-coloured at 600 lumens to smoke-coloured at 1000 lumens, homeowners can choose a lighting scheme that works with the room and their own aesthetics. Exposed bulbs with decorative Edison filaments meant to be seen rather than covered with shade or glass are now trending. Filaments can provide an additional design element with shape and style. The trendiest option is squirrel cage filaments because they have a nostalgic feel to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Recessed Lighting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recessed lighting can add many different lighting elements to your living area. Installing recessed lighting can range from one or two lights to several inlay lights or even track lighting. Fewer lights can act as spotlights, highlighting specific areas of the room. The darker areas, for example, can be styled as vignettes, and recessed lighting can function as a filtered light arrow, illuminating the line of vision. When recessed lights are purposefully arranged, a room can benefit from more ambient illumination than one or two overhead light fixtures can offer.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/\">Handyman Connection<\/a> in Vaughan to lighten your living area with a solution that works for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Homeowners need not embark on costly renovations to lighten up current living areas.

When properly cared for, a deck can also add a bit of beauty and value to your property. However, depending on the materials used to construct the deck, it will require maintenance. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/services\/painting\/\">painting services in Vaughan<\/a>, wood decking needs annual upkeep to ensure it remains in excellent condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the year and throughout the changing seasons, decking collects dirt, muck, and grime. Falling leaves, melting snow, rainstorms, animals, insects, and other elements affect the appearance of your deck. The best way to remove the gunk and restore the beauty is with a pressure washer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if you are unfamiliar with power washing, you can cause more harm to your deck. A pressure washer unleashes a stream of highly-focused water onto a small spot on your deck, if the pressure is held in that one spot for too long, you will remove wood. It helps to know the type of damage you may deal with when power washing your deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Splintering<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As any handyman in Vaughan can tell you, wood decks are notoriously vulnerable to power washing, especially when the planks are not treated often enough. Sealing wood boards helps them retain their shape and prevents excess moisture and dehydration. When boards become dry, they split. Using a pressure washer on boards that have previously split risks splintering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from splintering, a pressure washer might cause fragmentation. Fragmentation occurs when the jet stream blasts a chunk or piece of decking off the deck. You always need to use caution when using a power washer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood decking is not unique to splintering or damage. Softer materials, such as PVC, can also become damaged when put under the power of a pressure washer. Because of the potential damage, it is best to adjust the pressure to suit routine cleaning. Still, a pressure washer provides convenience, allowing homeowners to finish a task quickly, but with speed comes risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Sanding<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pressure washing the deck will likely result in a need for sanding the surface of it. A pressure washer wets the deck, resulting in raised fibres. As the wood dries, the fibres do not settle back into the board, they create a rough surface. The only way to restore a smooth finish and remove the fibres is by sanding the deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you can sand the deck, you will need to wait for it to dry. Luckily, pressure washing does not necessarily mean the entire deck needs sanding. Sometimes, the washing only causes rough spots in specific areas. If the entire deck is not rough, you can get away with surface spot sanding. Be careful about how much you sand when spot sanding. If you sand too much, your deck will become uneven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Stain or Finish Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pressure washing can also remove stains and any existing finishes on your deck. Because of the abrasive nature of pressure washing, professionals recommend power washing before you reseal your deck. Doing the finishing and staining after the deck is clean is the best way to seal it anyway, and it ensures your finish will last. However, you should wait for the deck to dry before applying any finish or stain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your deck is an attribute and it adds to your property&#8217;s curb appeal. When is the last time you cleaned the deck or finished it? While you might be eager to get outside and power wash the surface yourself, it is often best to let someone with experience handle the task. Contact a <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/\">professional with Handyman Connection<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/handymanconnection.com\/vaughan\/free-estimate\/\">schedule an estimate<\/a>.
